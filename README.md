# JustStudy
Android mobile application that was developed in Java.

Our application’s sole purpose is to help give the user a tool to assist them in studying for subjects
they need to study for. The software application we are going to develop is a learning tool that uses
flashcards, timed quizzes, matchmaking games and daily challenges to enhance one’s knowledge
on a given subject. This application is going to be developed as a mobile application. It is intended to
run on android phones and tablets.

This application uses Android Studios as a platform for development and the programming language
used to write the code is Java. Java will used in the backend of our application while XML will be
used for the frontend of our application. No databases will be used. All of our data will be store and
read from a text file.

Amount of information that the user will input to study, the type of information that the user will try to
input, how to manage a text file database, how to match a flash card to its description on the
matching game, how the quiz design will be made, and if the information that is inputted will either
be there when the application reopens or retains the information.

There are other applications out there that already have a “flash card” feature or mode in their
application. For our application, it will contain the flash card mode but have a unique twist to it being
able to allow the user to input their information to create their own flash cards instead of the flash
cards being already pre-made. Our vision for our flash card would have the front of the flash card to
be the text and the other side being the definition.
